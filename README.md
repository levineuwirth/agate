Experimental implementations of cryptography - done by a student, as a learning process

Apate is the deity of deceit. Let me not be deceived by the prospect of knowing of but not fundamentally understanding.
I will implement algorithms such as RSA myself to deeply understand how they work. I will do so well, so we change the p to a g to indicate they're "great" implementations.

A special thanks is given to:

Python, for having built-in bignum support :)

Professor Richard Schwartz, BrownU Mathematics, for intriguing my interest in cryptography as an application of Abstract Algebra 

The original inventors of these algorithms, for their pioneering work in keeping our communications and data safe
