# apate
Experimental implementations of cryptography - done by a student, as a learning process

Apate is the deity of deceit. Let me not be deceived by the prospect of knowing of but not fundamentally understanding.
I will implement algorithms such as RSA myself to deeply understand how they work.

A special thanks is given to:

Professor Richard Schwartz, BrownU Mathematics

The original RSA themselves, for pioneering cryptography in an open way.
